 Implementing data structures and algorithms in Java
 
* Dynamic Array Implementation
  * Implementation of Pascal's triangle (jagged arrays)
  * Printing all prime numbers till given n.
    * Theorem: Assume all numbers to be prime until proven false. 

* Singly Linked List
  * Standard singly linked list: push/pop front, insert(i), remove(i), reverse, removeValue
  * Queue implementation using a singly linked list with a tail pointer.

* Binary Search (not really a data structure, but its okay I guess)
  * Both iterative and recursive
  
* Binary Search Tree
  * Used generics for the first time!

* Hash Table
  * add, get, remove, hash(key).
  * Very simple hashing used. Next step could be to use prime numbers to make a decent hash.

* Binary Heap
  * Implemented Max Heap
  * Also includes a method for heapsort

* Graph Algorithms
  * Storing undirected and directed graphs
	* Methods to add & get edges and vertices. Used hashmaps for storing data.
  * BFS
  * DFS
  * Minimum Spanning Trees
    * Prim's algo
    * Kruskal's algo using UnionFind
  * Dijkstra's shortest path algo
  * Solutions to some leetcode questions on graphs
